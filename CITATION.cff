  Ensuring the reproducibility of scientific simulations is
  a persistent challenge,

  despite current best practices like version control and
  containerization.

  Factors such as floating-point arithmetic variations,
  hardware differences, and concurrency issues often prevent
  bit-for-bit replication of results.

  This paper investigates the solutions for deterministic
  computations that distributed ledger technologies employ
  and application of these concepts to enhance the
  reproducibility, trustworthiness and verifiability of
  scientific simulations.

  We explore two primary approaches: executing simulations
  directly ``on-chain'' for complete transparency and
  deterministic replay, and performing computations
  ``off-chain'' while anchoring their integrity to a
  blockchain via cryptographic proofs, such as
  Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and Merkle trees.

Performance Comparison Report
============================
Date: Wed Sep 24 10:28:19 AM CEST 2025
Test Configuration: 1,000,000 random walk steps
Run on CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) Ultra 5 135U

Testing with instrumentation (3 runs):
real 1.99
real 1.99
real 2.01

Testing without instrumentation (3 runs):
real 0.24
real 0.25
real 0.23

- Instrumented version includes function call tracing overhead
- Non-instrumented version has no tracing code compiled in
- Each run performs 1,000,000 function calls to random_walk_step()
- File I/O overhead in instrumented version affects performance

Trace file size: 89M function_trace.txt
